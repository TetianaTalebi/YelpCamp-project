# Project Overview / Description

YelpCamp is a full-stack CRUD application designed for managing campground data, user-generated content, and geolocation-based resources. The platform enables authenticated users to perform end-to-end operations on campgrounds, including data creation, modification, and deletion. Each campground supports associated metadata such as images, pricing, descriptions, and geographic coordinates.

The system provides the following user capabilities:

- Register and authenticate using session-based login
- Create new campgrounds enriched with photos, descriptions, prices and location data
- Edit and delete campgrounds they own, with full authorization checks
- Browse campgrounds created by other users
- Submit and manage reviews with rating and comment fields
- Delete their own reviews with ownership validation
